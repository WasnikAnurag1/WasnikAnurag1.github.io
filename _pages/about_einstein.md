Anurag Wasnik is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy at the Beedie School of Business, Simon Fraser University, where he examines the emergence and evolution of innovation ecosystems, entrepreneurial ecosystems, and the complexities of science commercialization, academic entrepreneurship, and innovation policy. His doctoral research is supervised by prominent innovation management scholars, including Dr. Elicia Maine and Dr. Jon Thomas.

Throughout his academic and professional journey, Anurag has earned prestigious scholarships, including those from the University of Chicago – Harris School of Public Policy (not availed), Bocconi Università, and the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. He has presented his research at international conferences and forums such as the R&D Management Conference in Stockholm, Sweden; Entrepeneurial Ecosystem Research School, Bilbao, Spain; the University of Bodo, Norway; the Global Strategy and Emerging Markets (GSEM) Conference in Mexico (scheduled); the Canadian Hydrogen Association (CHA) and Indian Hydrogen Association (IHA) joint call; and the EU-India Diaogue on Green Hydrogen.

Anurag’s dedication to innovation ecosystems—particularly in the energy and healthcare sectors—has guided him to publish in high-impact peer-reviewed journals such as the Springer Nature, International Journal of Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Marketing, the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care, De Gruyter, the Economics and Business Quarterly Review, and the Geographical Review of India. He has also contributed to policy whitepapers in collaboration with IIT Bombay, Denmark Technical University, NITI Aayog, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Rabo Foundation, Economic Research Insitute for ASEAN and East Asia, the Government of India, the Government of Denmark, and other multilateral organizations. In addition, he co-authored a book on Academic Entrepreneurship with Venture Centre, designed to help academic scientists bring their lab research to commercial reality. These combined efforts have influenced innovation policy-making both nationally and internationally, establishing Anurag as a respected voice in innovation management.

Before beginning his doctoral studies, Anurag served as an Innovation Lead at NITI Aayog (focusing on Energy and Innovation verticals), where he supported new ventures across renewable energy, healthcare, and frontier technologies. He collaborated closely with innovation attachés from various countries, building bilateral innovation partnerships between India and Israel, the USA, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Australia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. During this time, he was also among the co-founders of the Startup20-G20 Engagement group, providing a shared platform for startups in G20 nations to align on enabling capacity-building initiatives, identify funding gaps, support SDG goals, enhance climate resilience, and grow an inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystem. Working alongside Deloitte Consulting, Anurag and his team facilitated the publication of the Startup20 policy Communique, which received endorsement from G20 member countries.

While working with Industry, his Strategy Management Consultant role at Accenture Strategy and as an Energy Consultant with ONGC allowed him to gain practical experience in strategic innovation and sustainability adoption, particularly in energy transitions. These diverse professional engagements inform his current academic pursuits, offering a practitioner-focused perspective to his research.

Anurag remains an active participant in academic networks such as the Academy of Management (ENT and TIM divisions), the Strategic Management Society, and R&D Management. He frequently contributes to international discussions on entrepreneurial finance, university spinoffs, and innovation policy, emphasizing the significance of green hydrogen, circular economy practices, and deep-tech ventures for future-ready innovation ecosystems.

His blend of academic achievements and hands-on innovation policy experience has positioned Anurag as a dedicated innovation management emerging scholar, recognized for effectively bridging the gap between theory, policy, and practice.
